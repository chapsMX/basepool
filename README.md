# BasePool

BasePool is a provably fair pool game built on Base network using Coinbase's MiniKit for Farcaster integration. Players can participate by sending ETH to get assigned numbers, with the chance to win the pool when it reaches 0.5 ETH.

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **Participation**
   - For every 0.0005 ETH sent to the contract, you get assigned one number
   - There's no limit on the amount you can send per transaction
   - The only requirement is that the amount must be a multiple of 0.0005 ETH
   - Examples of participation:
     - Send 0.0005 ETH = Get 1 number
     - Send 0.001 ETH = Get 2 numbers
     - Send 0.005 ETH = Get 10 numbers
     - And so on...

2. **Pool Mechanics**
   - The pool accumulates ETH from all participants
   - When the pool reaches 0.5 ETH:
     - A random number is generated using Pyth Network
     - The next transaction triggers:
       - The pool balance is sent to the winning number
       - A new pool automatically starts
   - The game runs continuously and autonomously
   - Pool parameters (0.5 ETH target, 0.0005 ETH per number) are fixed and cannot be modified
